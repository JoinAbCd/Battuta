        <p id="tribute-info"> <b>Ibn Battuta</b> Shams al-Din Abu’Abdallah Muhammad ibn’Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Lawati al-Tanji
            was a Muslim Berber-Moroccan scholar, jurist and explorer who widely travelled the Old World,
            largely in the lands of Dar al-Islam.<br> He travelled more than any other explorer in pre-modern history, totalling around 117,000 km (72,000 miles),
            surpassing Zheng He with about 50,000 km, (30,000 miles) and Marco Polo with 24,000 km (15,000 miles). Over a period of thirty years, Ibn Battuta visited most of the Old World,
            including Central Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, China and the Iberian Peninsula.<br> Near the end of his life, he dictated an account of his journeys, <br>
            titled A Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling, but commonly known as The Rihla.
